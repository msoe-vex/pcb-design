# RS-485 to USB Serial Board
This project is dedicated to creating a board that can interface between the smart ports on the V5 Robot Brain and the USB of our co-processor, which requires converting two RS-485 channels (one RX, one TX) into USB Serial.

### Project Information
This board was originally created by Andrew Kempen during the 2020-2021 VEX ChangeUp season.
