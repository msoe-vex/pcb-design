# Pneumatic Control Unit
This project is dedicated to creating a board that can control 8 pneumatic devices running at either 5V or 12V from the VEX V5 brain. We take power from the smart ports to power the pneumatics, then based on the jumpers will step down the voltage to 5V or keep it at 12V. The signal sent to the board will be read by a MicoMod teensy and will then send a signal to the corresponding pneumatic device. The transmit port is for future versions.

### Project Information
This board was originally created by Nathan Roth and Asher Sprigler, with assistance provided by Andrew Kempen in the 2021-2022 VEX season.
