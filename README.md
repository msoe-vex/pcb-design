# PCB and Circuitry Design Repository
This repository is dedicated to storing files required for designing and creating PCBs for our robots. Different projects are put in separate folders, and an included "README.md" file should be included with each project to explain the purpose of each.

## Software Installation
These projects largely use the KiCAD application for circuitry and PCB design. This software can be installed from the following link: 

https://downloads.kicad.org/kicad/windows/explore/nightlies/download/kicad-msvc.r24754.1860893d63-x86_64.exe

**NOTE: We will be using a nightly version until KiCAD 6.00 is released later this year!**

Other versions for various OS platforms can also be found on their website.
